# Moodies
Moodies is a webpage made for helping people decide where to eat, based on their mood they are in, as well as the weather    

When our team was tasked with solving a common problem, we realize that it always took people so long to figure out where we wanted to eat. Then, when we finally did decide where to eat, the environment of the place was all wrong for how what we actually wanted at the time.

That was where Moodies was born! Our webpage will take into account not only your location, but also your mood and the weather. So that you'll never have to suffer through patio dining when its freezing outside, or constantly be interrupted by waiters when you are already in a bad mood.
